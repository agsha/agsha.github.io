            <p class="blog-post-meta">Thu, 23 Jun 2016</p>
		    <p>I have just returned from a 8 day trip to Bali. Here are some tips and info, fresh off my mind. These are points that I wish I knew before my trip to Bali, and the tips that I never came across online or on tripadvisor reviews.</p>
<h3>Flight</h3>
<p>If you're leaving from bangalore, then consider going first to kochi or chennai, and then going to Bali. It worked out cheaper for me. Flight from Blore to kochi was ~ INR 1000 and flight from kochi to Bali was ~ INR 15000. A direct flight from Blore to Bali was in comparison around INR 24000. An aside: airport food is annoyingly expensive and not good at all. Strongly recommend <em>packing</em> enough food to last you till your destination --- including layovers. </p>
<p>If you're travelling in Air Asia, beware! They're the stingiest aircraft I've ever flown in. They don't even offer water for free, even on international routes. Let alone food. Furthermore, <strong>check-in baggage is not free!</strong> it cost me around 5000 Rupees extra for one piece of check-in luggage. Oh, yes. If you forget to call and pay for check-in baggage before hand, then the cost is <em>really</em> exorbitant if you check-in at the airport counter.</p>
<h3>Visa requirements for indians</h3>
<p>This was the best part about the Bali trip. <strong>Bali has FREE visa-on-arrival for indians!</strong> Furthermore, they asked almost NO documents. He simply took one look at my passport and stamped "visa approved for 6 months". Even the immigration wait line was non-existent. The whole immigration process took around 2 minutes. Very pleasant experience.</p>
<h3>Currency conversion</h3>
<p>Take USD to Bali, not INR. None of the banks I saw exchanged INR for IDR (Indonesian rupiah). On the other hand, literally every other street has 'money changing' shops which changes USD to IDR (And they are legit). I strongly recommend buying dollars. </p>
<p>I also had my ICICI debit card that worked pretty seamlessly in Bali. I called up ICICI beforehand that I would be using it in Bali. The card was declined in a couple of shops but accepted at around 90% of the shops. I could also draw IDR from most ATMS. For transaction in shops, ICICI charges 3% + competitive currency conversion. For ATM cash withdrawal, ICICI charges INR 125 + 3% of money withdrawn. Most services in Bali don't accept cards. So whenever you can use the card, use it.</p>
<p>Something that I did not do, but I should have is that I should have checked with ICICI what happens in the even I lose my debit card and am short of cash. </p>
<h3>Getting around in Bali</h3>
<p>Bali is a pretty small place. Most places are within an hour or two driving distance. Definitely get a rental motorbike in Bali. Its super convenient. They charge ~INR 300 per day of rental. Public transportation is almost non existant from what I saw. Although, legally, you need an international driving license to ride a motorbike, It is generally tolerated. Even when caught by the police, the fines are low. Around INR 500. I got caught by the police once: when I was driving on the
wrong direction of a one way. I paid around INR 500 as fine and the police dusted my bike seat and showed me the direction to my destination and helped me along the way. You can see firangs (obviously not Balinese) zipping along in bikes all over Bali. </p>
<h3>Bargain hard</h3>
<p>Every service in Bali is overpriced, and it is expected that you bargain. Usually you can get a 35% - 50% reduction in the quoted price. Balinese are very friendly (and sympathetic) towards indians as compared to firangs and it is possible to strike better deals than what firangs can manage. So don't be shy to ask for a discount. </p>
<h3>Names and the caste system in Bali.</h3>
<p>There are only four first names in Bali: Ketut, komang, wayan, Made (pronounced Madi). The way it works is:
Let <code>String[] A = {"Ketut", "komang", "wayan", "Made"}</code> be a string array where the index is 0-based. i.e., <code>A[0]</code> is <code>"ketut"</code>. Now if you're the <code>x</code> <sup>th</sup> eldest son (where the eldest son is <code>1</code>, and so on), then your first name is <code>A[(x-1)%4]</code>. The last name of course is different. Curiously though, people always tell their first name (one of the four said names) when you ask them their name. </p>
<h3>Telephone SIM card and 3G</h3>
<p>The very first thing you should do when you land is Bali is: you should get a local SIM card with a 3G data limit of ~2GB.</p>
<p>3G Coverage in Bali is excellent and google maps is your friend in Bali. Oh yeah. <strong>Definitely carry a extra battery pack (or power pack) for your cell phone</strong>. Its a life saver. This was easily the most important thing I carried to Bali</p>
<h3>Places to visit.</h3>
<p>If this is your first time in Bali, then from an indian point of view, and depending on how long you're planning to visit, this is your order of priority for places to stay. </p>
<h4>Seminyak</h4>
<p>Total party area with nice beaches and shopping, also accessible to other places like Uluwatu temple in the south and Tanah lot in the north. (No trip to Bali is complete without a visit to these two). Catch the sunset in both places. Its breathtaking. I did explore three or four beaches but I didnt like most of them. For example, kuta beach doesnt have a lot of 'beach' area (The distances from where the waves end to where the roads begin). Sanur beach totally sucked. It has white sands but
its gravelly and rocky. Very uncomfortable. Beti-balug beach in seminyak has nice sand but not so popular and seems a little ghetto. The only one I liked was double-six beach. Its got everything. Beach chairs, soft sand, lots of restaurants nearby and tons of activities. Perfect for spending an entire day.</p>
<h4>Ubud</h4>
<p>Best place to stay is right next to monkey forest. Very cultural place and worth exploring the 'non-beachy' side of Bali. From there you can explore other areas in and near ubud, like tagalalong rice terrace, tegunnen water falls etc.</p>
<h4>Nusa Penida</h4>
<p>Little off the main touristy spot (its a separate island). I never visited it but I wish I had. Its got lots of stuff to do according to <a href="https://indonesia.tripcanvas.co/bali/unique-places-in-bali/page/3/">this link</a></p>
<h3>Voltage specs in Bali</h3>
<p>Bali uses the same kind of round pins that we use in india. Not the flat rectangular pins from US. But one major problem: The socket is "hollow" <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g1465999-d1539040-i79297910-The_Wangsa_Private_Estate-Tanjung_Benoa_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html">like this</a>. So if your charger body is bulky, it won't fit inside the hollowness of the sockets. None of my chargers from india fit in the socket. Luckily every airbnb that I stayed had a Bali adapter
or a Bali charger that allowed me to charge.</p>
