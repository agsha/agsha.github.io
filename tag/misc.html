        <small class="text-body-secondary">Fri, 11 Oct 2024</small>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by the rank theorem in linear algebra. It is known sometimes by other names:</p>
<ol>
<li>The rank-nullity theorem</li>
<li>Fundamental theorem of linear algebra (part 1)</li>
</ol>
<p>Stated simply, The rank theorem asserts that in any matrix, the row rank is equal to the column rank.</p>
<p>The result …</p>

<p>Thanks to advances in compiler technologies, Programmers today are spoilt for choice with the myriad of mainstream programming languages available your next big idea. However, the landscape can quickly get confusing. Many different languages seem to offer the same features and generally "looks the same". Consider the website description …</p>

        <p>In this post, I compare the rpc throughput of some existing RPC frameworks and talk about a new technique of doing RPC .
